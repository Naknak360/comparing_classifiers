    "**ANSWER:** Based on analyzing the coefficients of the logistic regression model above, I can conclude that the least important features in our feature space is the 'age' of the person being called and whether the person has responded 'yes' to having a housing loan. I am confident that this is the case because we have standard scaled all numeric inputs and have one hot encoded all of our categorical features, making them properly scaled to each other with respects to the L2 regularization. If I had to personally choose any feature to remove first, it would be 'age' as that is a more clean cut numeric feature. \n",
